  "Guards the protocol `normalize-asset-resource-url` builds local asset URLs with.

   On Electron it must be assets://, never file://. The renderer document is
   served over the privileged lsp:// scheme, and Chromium refuses a file://
   subresource from that origin: an <img> fails silently and pdf.js reports the
   blocked read as `Missing PDF \"file:///...pdf\"`, which reads as a deleted
   file. The scheme half of the contract -- that an assets:// URL is actually
   fetchable from the renderer's origin -- is asserted against a real Electron
   in test/electron-js/asset-protocol.test.mjs."
